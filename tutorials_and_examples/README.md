# Tutorials and Examples

The purpose for these Tutoriales/Examples is to get you familiar with QBit, teach you how to use it, and show you some of its microservices.

Tutorials/Examples are classified:

__[Rough Cut]__ - little instruction assumes you know QBit basics are pick on the uptake.
Rough cuts will one day be a Quick Start or even a Detailed Tutorial, but right now; it is documentation.

__[Quick Start]__ - Code centric tutorial focusing more on code then explanation.

__[Detailed Tutorial]__ - A lot of theory, explanation and background with some hand holding.

__[Doc]__ - Documments that are either code centric or contain alot of theory/explanations. Eventually will become Detailed Tutorial or Quick Start, but for now; it is documentation.

The next two section will show how to build and install QBit and boon on your machine.
